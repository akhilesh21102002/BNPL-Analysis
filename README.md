This project examines the behavioral impact of Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) services using a survey dataset of Indonesian BNPL users and non-users ([source](https://lnkd.in/gQ6YFJtC)). The analysis focuses on impulsive buying tendencies and post-purchase regret.

Results show that BNPL users exhibit higher spending volatility and delayed regret, while non-users experience immediate but milder regret. The analysis was conducted in Python using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
